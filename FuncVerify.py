# Verify whether the given equation is a function

"""
A function is a relation between domain and range such that each value in the domain corresponds to only one value in the range. Relations that are not functions violate this definition. They feature at least one value in the domain that corresponds to two or more values in the range [1]

Function violation is a one-to-many relation
One input does not one output

To test we must first be able to evaluate the function
